# ü™ì CHOP: Comment Header Organization System for Python

> *Slice your code into clean, readable chunks‚Äîlike a pro.*

CHOP is a custom VS Code snippet pack designed to help you keep your code beautifully structured and **visually readable**. It brings class, function, and group headers into your workflow with minimal effort and maximum style.

---

## üå± Origin Story

CHOP started as a personal system I made for myself because I found Python‚Äôs indentation-based scoping to be hard to follow. I wanted something that made scopes more *visually* obvious and made large files easier to navigate.

So I started manually adding these headers... and it turned out to be an awesome way to organize everything. Eventually, I turned the system into a VS Code snippet pack so I wouldn‚Äôt have to keep copy/pasting. Now it‚Äôs quick and clean.
